# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This is a **design documentation repository** for "misnote" (間違いノートアプリ) — a digital mistake-notebook app targeting elementary/middle/high school students. It allows users to record wrong/difficult questions and schedule spaced-repetition reviews. There is no implementation code here; all files are Markdown design documents.

## Architecture Summary

**Frontend:** Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS

**Backend:** FastAPI (Python) + SQLAlchemy ORM + Pydantic validation

**API contract flow:**
1. FastAPI auto-generates `openapi.json` at runtime
2. `openapi-generator-cli` converts it to TypeScript types + fetch client under `frontend/src/generated/`
3. Next.js consumes the generated client — no hand-written fetch calls

**Infrastructure (AWS):** Cognito (auth/JWT) → API Gateway → ECS+Fargate (FastAPI) → RDS PostgreSQL. CloudWatch for logging.

**Auth:** All API requests require `Authorization: Bearer {Cognito JWT}`. Base URL: `https://api.misnote.com/v1`.

## Key DB Design Decisions

- `unit_id` on `questions` is nullable (questions can exist without a unit); when set, the unit must belong to the question's subject
- `mistake_notes.question_id` is UNIQUE — one note per question. An incorrect attempt creates the note if absent, otherwise updates it (`wrong_count` +1, `correct_streak` reset, `mastered` reverts to `active`)
- `correct_streak` on `mistake_notes` tracks consecutive correct answers; at 3 the API sets `mastery_suggested: true` and the UI *suggests* mastering — the transition to `mastered` is always a user action, never automatic
- `next_review_at` is user-set (not auto-calculated) and nullable; `GET /mistake-notes/today` filters by this date and excludes `null` (the home screen shows unscheduled notes separately)
- `attempts.user_answer` is optional — the review flow is self-graded
- All PKs are UUIDs; all tables are scoped to `user_id` for data isolation
